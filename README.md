# Automatic Water Dispenser Prototype - Rhino camp refugee settlement Uganda.

**Description**

*This is a motor driven system that allows user to access water in a tank by touching a sensor once*

*We are working on this simple DIY project to help students use it in the school compound for handwashing*

*When washing hands using a conventional/traditional tap, you must touch it with your dirty hands to turn it onâ€”leaving behind germs, bacteria, and viruses* *Automatic taps controlled by a sensor are therefore a good alternative for making hand washing more hygienic, especially in schools where students live*

**Challenges**

*The mechanical part ( system to push water flow when running the system and closing  after running the system )  of the prototype has been difficult to work on*

**Future Improvements**

*Use of Infra-red sensores (temperature sensor)*

**Vision Statement**
Providing refugee schools with non touchable (Automatic) locally made water dispenser.

**Materials**

*Arduino Uno*

*Laptop with a IDE software*

*Batteries* 

*Touch pad sensor*

*Wires*

*LED Light*

*PC with the IDE*

*5v motor*

*Water Container*

*Bread board

``` // Maliamungu touch water dispenser prototype.


// When Sig Output is high, touch sensor is being pressed

#define ctsPin 2

// Pin for capactitive touch sensor

int motor = 13;

// pin for the LED

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);

pinMode(motor, OUTPUT);

pinMode(ctsPin, INPUT);

}

void loop() {
  int ctsValue = digitalRead(ctsPin);

if (ctsValue == HIGH)
{

Serial.println("TOUCHED");

}

else{

digitalWrite(motor,LOW);

Serial.println("not touched");

}
